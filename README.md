Beside employing Python for my research projects, I also conduct some data analysis projects using Python as follows.

# [**Mini Project 1**](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_projects)

- Check valid password 
- Format & remove duplicates in an array
- Calculate tax payable


# [**Project 2**](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_project2)

Suppose you are a DA in an e-wallet company, and you need to analyze the following datasets:
1.	payment_report.csv (monthly payment volume of products)
2.	product.csv (product information)
3.	transactions.csv (transactions information)
