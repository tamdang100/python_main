## **Beside employing Python for my research projects, I have also conducted some data analytics projects using Python as follows.**

# [**Mini Project 1**](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_projects)

- Check valid password 
- Format & remove duplicates in an array
- Calculate tax payable


# [**Project 2** - E-Wallet company - Data wrangling](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_project2)

Suppose you are a Data Analyst in an e-wallet company, and you need to analyze the following datasets:
-	payment_report.csv (monthly payment volume of products)
-	product.csv (product information)
-	transactions.csv (transactions information)
  
You need to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the datasets and then conduct data wrangling.


# [**Project 3 - Credit risk modelling - A machine learning model**](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_creditrisk)

Based on the dataset related to credit risk and contains information about individuals who have taken loans, I develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan default based on various financial and demographic factors of the borrowers.
