## **Beside employing Python for my research projects, I have also conducted some data analytics projects using Python as follows.**

# [**Mini Project 1**](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_projects)

- Check valid password 
- Format & remove duplicates in an array
- Calculate tax payable


# [**Project 2** - E-Wallet company - Data wrangling](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_project2)

An e-wallet company needs to analyze the following datasets:
-	payment_report.csv (monthly payment volume of products)
-	product.csv (product information)
-	transactions.csv (transactions information)
  
We need to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the datasets and then conduct data wrangling.


# [**Project 3 - Credit risk modelling - A machine learning model**](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_creditrisk)

Based on the dataset related to credit risk and contains information about individuals who have taken loans, I develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan default based on various financial and demographic factors of the borrowers.


# [**Project 4 - Data-Driven Customer Segmentation: RFM Model for SuperStore**](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_rfm_project)

SuperStore is a global retail company with a large number of customers. On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing department wants to run marketing campaigns to show appreciation to the customers who have supported the company throughout the year, as well as to target potential customers who could become loyal customers.

However, the Marketing department has not yet been able to segment each customer group for this year because the dataset is too large to process manually as in previous years. Therefore, they are seeking assistance from the Data Analysis department to implement a segmentation classification task for each customer to deploy appropriate marketing programs for each customer group.

The Marketing Director has also proposed using the RFM model; however, in the past, when the company's scale was smaller, the team could calculate and classify using Excel. Currently, due to the large amount of data, they hope the Data department can develop a flow to evaluate segmentation through Python programming.
